## About the project
MojiraBot was written by [violine1101](https://github.com/violine1101) for use with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), first in a single JavaScript file and later in [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/). Its purpose is to link to Mojira tickets and provide information about them inside of Discord. It also provides some moderation tools.

## Usage
If you want to tinker around with the project on your local PC or run your own instance of the bot, you can simply go ahead!

Here's a guide on how you can do that.

### Prerequisites
You need to have installed Git, node.js, and NPM.

In order to use a Discord bot, you need to create one on the Discord developer portal.

### Cloning the repository
You can download this repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mojira/mojira-discord-bot.git
```

### Installation
In order to install the dependencies, simply use this command:

```
npm install
```

### Configuration
There are multiple configuration files that are used to configure the bot. They are all located in the directory `config`.

In order to run the bot, you need to set up a `local.yml` file for the bot's credentials. In order to do so, follow the steps outlined in the `local.template.yml` file.

There are multiple deployment configurations for different instances of the bot. Currently the following configurations are available:
- `main` – Main MojiraBot on the Mojira Discord server
- `beta` – violine1101's beta testing bot

You can create another configuration like that for your own bot.

An overview / documentation of all config options can be found in `template.yml`.

### Running
#### Testing / development
For testing or development purposes, it is recommended to run the bot using the following command:

```
NODE_ENV=<deployment> npm run bot
```

where `<deployment>` is the name of a deployment configuration (`main` or `beta`).

#### Deployment
To deploy the bot, you need to run the following command:

```
./start.sh <deployment>
```

where `<deployment>` is the name of a deployment configuration (`main` or `beta`).

Note that the bot is started in a detached screen, which means you won't see any output and the bot is running in the background.

You can stop the bot with `./stop.sh <deployment>` or restart it with `./restart.sh <deployment>`.

				This is a bot that links to a Mojira ticket when its ticket number is mentioned.
				Currently, the following projects are supported: ${ BotConfig.projects.join( ', ' ) }
				To prevent the bot from linking a ticket, preface the ticket number with an exclamation mark.
				
				To check whether the bot is currently running, you can use \`!jira ping\`. This bot is continuously being worked on and this will receive more features in the future.
				It is not possible to invite this bot to other servers yet.
				If you have any issues, feel free to ping violine1101.
